Nearby, Scalawag and his colleague Igor advertise a three-shell game which cheats people out of their money, leading to Scalawag's and Igor's escape by using a cannon to get away from the angry mob. Scalawag meets Pinocchio and trades the Jewel box a ruby, which turns out to be a fake when Pinocchio gets home, which angers Geppetto. Pinocchio runs away to the Carnival where he watches a performance, and falls in love with the star puppet, Twinkle. After the people leave, the Puppet Master, Puppetino, tells Pinnochio about what it takes to be a performer, then transforms him into a puppet in an evil fashion. With help from Willikers and the Fairy Godmother, Pinocchio eventually escapes from the Carnvial to find the Jewel box, promising Twinkle along the way that he will find a way to make her real as well. Pinocchio meets with Scalawag and Igor and demands the Jewel box. Scalawag tells Pinocchio that he does not have it and says that they were outnumbered by a gang of thieves lead by Puppetino who took it.

But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike.

Santosh, Akhilendra Mishra", "Plot": "Bhagat was born in British India during the year 1908. As a child he witnessed numerous atrocities committed on fellow Indians by their British rulers, who came to trade under the guise of the East India Company, but ended up controlling most of the nation, and permitting tyrants such as General Dyer to massacre thousands of innocent men, women and children in Jallianwala Baug. As a child he was impressed by Mohandas K. Gandhi, especially his call to launch the non-cooperation movement, which led to thousands of people burning British-made clothing, giving up schools, & college studies, and government jobs - only to be let down by Gandhi himself when he called off the movement. Undaunted, Bhagat decided to be a revolutionary, starting with getting into petty fights, then as a grown-up joining the Hindustan Republic Association. When Lala Lajpat Rai was beaten to death by the police, Bhagat, along with Shivram Rajguru, Sukhdev, and others daringly carried out the assassination of a police officer named Saunders, which eventually led to Bhagat's arrest, where he was lodged in a cell, tortured and beaten mercilessly. His father, Kishan, paid Rs.60,000/- and bailed him out, so that he could get him to run a diary-farm and get married to a girl from Manavali. But being a revolutionary was in Bhagat's blood, and when the British proposed the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, he would initiate the bombing in the Indian Parliament Building, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, be arrested, and tried in an open court. This is where Bhagat launched his much-publicized revolution, and became popular with the masses, especially the younger generation, laborers, and farmers, so much so that his popularity rivaled that of Gandhi himself. Even in prison, Bhagat made headline news when he and other prisoners undertook a 63 day fast unto death to improve the conditions of Indian freedom-fighter prisoners. Then the British re-opened the Saunders' murder case, which led to death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Shivram, and Sukhdev. The entire nation rose up in protest, including the Congress party - with the ball being in Gandhi's court - for he was due to sign the Irwing Pact, and Indians hoped that he would use this as a bargaining chip to save the lives of the heroic trio. Will Gandhi rise up to the occasion and save the trio - so that they could pave the way for a modern and independent India, not just a country ruled by the British with a dominant status - an India free of communal hatred, injustice, corruption, and fundamentalism, or will Gandhi end up disappointing Bhagat all over again?", "Language": "Hindi, English, Bengali, Punjabi", "Country": "India", "Awards": "10 wins & 3 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NGRhMWMtZDdkOS00ZjcxLWI2OTAtOTI3ZWU0YWM3MGM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "8.1/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "8.1", "imdbVotes": "12,262", "imdbID": "tt0319736", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "06 Jan 2004", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, "tt0887745": {"Title": "How About You...", "Year": "2007", "Rated": "Not Rated", "Released": "16 Nov 2007", "Runtime": "87 min", "Genre": "Comedy, Drama", "Director": "Anthony Byrne", "Writer": "Maeve Binchy (short story), Jean Pasley (screenplay)", "Actors": "Joss Ackland, Hayley Atwell, Orla Brady, Kevin Flood", "Plot": "HOW ABOUT YOU tells the story of Ellie, a young woman left in charge of the residential home run by her older sister, over the Christmas period.

Joel has had a long friendship with the Crowninshield's daughter, Priscilla Crowninshield, that friendship which is now on the brink of romantic love as they become of age, although this new-found love is unspoken on both sides. Joel hopes that when his eldest brother, Mark Shore, captain of the Nathan Ross, returns home from his latest voyage, he will allow Joel to sail with him. Although Mark still sees Joel as the \"youngin'\" of the family, Joel, through slightly underhanded means, is able to convince Mark that he is man enough to become a sailor. Also on this layover at home, Mark notices that Priscilla has become a beautiful young woman, who he now wants to marry. Mark arranges the engagement with his father and Priscilla's father without Priscilla's knowledge. The public announcement of the engagement shocks both Joel and Priscilla, the latter who has no romantic interest in Mark. On the Nathan Ross' first sailing following the engagement, that sailing to Singapore, Captain Mark makes a decision that unwittingly sets off a series of events that jeopardize both his and Joel's lives, but also tests whether in this situation family and brotherly loyalty or being with the woman you love is more important.", "Language": "English", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "N/A", "Poster": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MDU2MzA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODgzMDAyMw@@._V1._CR43.883331298828125,58.53334045410156,272,417_SX89_AL_.jpg_V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.3/10"}], "Metascore": "N/A", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "821", "imdbID": "tt0018618", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "N/A", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "N/A", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, "tt0100631": {"Title": "Ski Patrol", "Year": "1990", "Rated": "PG", "Released": "12 Jan 1990", "Runtime": "91 min", "Genre": "Action, Comedy", "Director": "Rich Correll", "Writer": "Steven Long Mitchell (story), Craig W.

The war deprived him of his family, and afterwards he endlessly turns over the soil of Antwerp to find the suitcases, which makes him look obsessed.

She finds a place as a nanny in the strictly observant Chassidic family with many children, although her secular manners clearly fly in the face of many commandments. One of the reasons she is accepted is that mother of the family is absolutely overburdened by the household, so she stays despite the resistance of the father, normally - an indisputable authority in the family. She develops a special bond with the youngest of the boys, four-year old Simcha, so far incapable of speaking. She teaches him while walking in the park, and it seems that during the upcoming Passover Seder, Simcha will be able to chant parts of the Haggadah. The old repulsive superintendent of the building is a constant wet blanket for the entire family and now for Chaya. However, as opposed to the observant Jews, she cannot be a victim and is not going to put up with his anti-Semitic tricks, so she fights him, thus exciting the children's admiration and family head's wrath. Unfortunately, walks with Simcha end in a tragedy: after sneaking to the park, he drowns in the pond, and some Chassids hold Chaya responsible. A beautiful, warm picture filled with compassion and humanism, making understandable even the behavior of the superintendent - a mean pathetic anti-Semite: he is so terribly lonely that has only his dog to talk to.", "Language": "English, Hebrew, Yiddish", "Country": "Netherlands, UK, Belgium, USA", "Awards": "5 wins & 4 nominations.", "Poster": "https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1OTc5OTYyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0NDcxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Ratings": [{"Source": "Internet Movie Database", "Value": "7.4/10"}, {"Source": "Rotten Tomatoes", "Value": "42%"}, {"Source": "Metacritic", "Value": "51/100"}], "Metascore": "51", "imdbRating": "7.4", "imdbVotes": "2,655", "imdbID": "tt0119512", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "10 Jul 2001", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Castle Hill Productions", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True"}, "tt0993846": {"Title": "The Wolf of Wall Street", "Year": "2013", "Rated": "R", "Released": "25 Dec 2013", "Runtime": "180 min", "Genre": "Biography, Crime, Drama", "Director": "Martin Scorsese", "Writer": "Terence Winter (screenplay), Jordan Belfort (book)", "Actors": "Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey", "Plot": "Jordan Belfort is a Long Island penny stockbroker who served 22 months in prison for defrauding investors in a massive 1990s securities scam that involved widespread corruption on Wall Street and in the corporate banking world, including shoe designer Steve Madden.", "Language": "English, French", "Country": "USA", "Awards": "Nominated for 5 Oscars.

Based on interviews with the students, not only was Arnold charged with and ultimately convicted of multiple counts of sodomy and sexual abuse of these boys but so was eighteen year old Jesse, who was mentioned by many as the aggressor of the two in the acts. Arnold admitted that he is a pedophile, but that he did not abuse the boys in his class as charged and convicted.

Created in 50 AD, the wood panels of the Loculus are emblazoned with two images: the Ankh symbol - a looped crucifix - and the Caduceus - a rod entwined with two serpents. On its perilous journey through history, the Loculus was further adorned with more arcane mystical imagery including pentagrams, hexagrams, a crucified serpent, the naked human form divine and a hermaphrodite. And many have tried to unlock the secret of the sacred artefact - a secret only a chosen few know contains profound and overwhelming ramifications for mankind. In 1299 a Jewish alchemist's attempts to unravel the enigma ended in disaster. And in 1710 Sir Isaac Newton, discoverer of the laws of gravity and a foremost member of the Masonic Order of the Knights Templar, also strove to answer the riddle. But with the art of science in its infancy, Newton realised the Underground Stream of research needed to solve the puzzle would have to flow for several more centuries before the prophesied ultimate Great Work could be wrought in all its glory. Now, the Loculus, missing for hundreds of years, has reappeared again...
